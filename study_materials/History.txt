Topic: The Roman Republic and Empire

The history of ancient Rome is a cornerstone of Western civilization, evolving from a small city-state into a vast empire that dominated the Mediterranean world.

The Roman Republic (509 BCE - 27 BCE):

Established after the overthrow of the Etruscan monarchy.

Governed by elected officials, primarily two consuls, and the Senate.

Famous for its legal system and military expansion, which led to control over Italy and beyond.

Key figures include Julius Caesar, a brilliant general and politician whose rise to power and subsequent assassination marked the beginning of the Republic's end.

The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE):

Began with the rise of Augustus (Octavian), who became the first emperor.

Characterized by a stable, centralized government and a period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (Roman Peace).

The Empire was responsible for significant achievements in architecture (aqueducts, colosseum), engineering, and law.

The Empire eventually grew too large to manage, facing internal political instability, economic decline, and invasions from barbarian tribes. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 CE.
