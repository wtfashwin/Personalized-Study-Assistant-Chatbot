Topic: The Periodic Table of Elements

The periodic table is an organized chart of all known chemical elements. It arranges elements by increasing atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

Groups (Columns): The vertical columns are called groups. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell).

Group 1 (Alkali Metals): Highly reactive metals like Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), and Potassium (K).

Group 17 (Halogens): Highly reactive nonmetals like Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), and Bromine (Br).

Group 18 (Noble Gases): Unreactive gases like Helium (He) and Neon (Ne) due to their full valence electron shells.

Periods (Rows): The horizontal rows are called periods. Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.

Types of Chemical Bonds:

Ionic Bond: A type of chemical bond formed between two ions with opposite charges. It typically occurs between a metal and a nonmetal, where one atom gives up an electron and the other accepts it. Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl).

Covalent Bond: A bond in which atoms share pairs of electrons. This typically occurs between two nonmetals. Example: Water (H 
2
​
 O) and Methane (CH 
4
​
 ).

Metallic Bond: A bond found in metals, where a "sea" of delocalized electrons is shared among a lattice of positively charged ions.
